# What Is This Repo? (And What Is a Repo?)

> If you're new to or need a refresher to GitHub, start here. This page explains everything in plain language.

---

## The short version

This repo contains all materials for the **Copilot CLI intro session** — slides, exercise prompts, cheat sheets, and setup guides. You're here to grab exercise prompts during the session and reference materials after.

Follow the path below. You can complete the workshop by browsing, copying prompts, and talking to CLI.

**Your journey through these materials:**

> 📖 **You are here** → [Setup Guide](pre-work/setup-guide.md) → [Verify Checklist](pre-work/verify-checklist.md) → **Session day!** → [Exercise 1](exercises/exercise-01-build-your-briefing.md) → [Exercise 2](exercises/exercise-02-pick-your-scenario.md) → [Exercise 3](exercises/exercise-03-your-copilot-passport.md) → [Cheat Sheet](reference/cheat-sheet.md) → [After-Session Resources](reference/after-session-resources.md)

## Wait — what's a "repo"?

A **repository** (repo) is just a shared folder on the internet. Think of it like a OneDrive folder, but:
- It has version history (every change is tracked)
- Anyone with access can see the same files
- It's where developers keep their work — and now where we keep ours

**GitHub** is the website that hosts repos. You're on it right now.

## The most important thing to know about Copilot CLI

**You don't need to memorize commands or syntax.** Copilot CLI understands plain language. Just type what you want, like you'd ask a colleague:

- `Help me prepare for my meeting with Contoso tomorrow`
- `What projects do I have that are missing outcomes?`
- `Why did that last command fail?`
- `How do I connect a new MCP server?`

If you're unsure about something, just ask. Literally type "how do I..." or "what is..." and it will explain. You can also use `/ask` to ask a side question without interrupting your current work.

**The prompts in the exercise sheets are starting points, not scripts.** Feel free to rephrase, follow up, or go in a completely different direction. There's no wrong way to talk to it.

## How do I use this during the session?

You have two options. Pick whichever feels more comfortable:

### Option 1: Just browse on GitHub (easiest)

Start here if you do not care where the files live. Browse, copy, paste.

1. You're already here — this page is on GitHub
2. Click on the **`exercises/`** folder in the file list above
3. Click on the exercise file (e.g., `exercise-01-build-your-briefing.md`)
4. Copy the prompts you need and paste them into Copilot CLI

That's it. No installation, no terminal magic. Just browse and copy.

### Option 2: Clone the repo to your machine (more useful long-term)

**🔧 Going deeper (optional)** — Clone the repo if you want CLI to read local files with `@filename` or if you want to keep your own notes.

"Cloning" means downloading the entire folder to your laptop. Useful because:
- Files are on your machine — works offline
- Copilot CLI can read files directly with `@filename`
- You can add your own notes

**How to clone:**

Open PowerShell and run these lines.

```powershell
cd ~\projects
git clone https://github.com/JW-Sthlm/cli-intro.git
cd cli-intro\v2
```

> **Don't have `git`?** Run `winget install Git.Git` first, then restart PowerShell.

> **What does `cd` mean?** It stands for "change directory" — like double-clicking a folder in File Explorer. `cd ~\projects` means "go to my projects folder."

Now all files are in `C:\Users\<you>\projects\cli-intro\v2\`. You can open them in any text editor or browse them in File Explorer.

## Jargon decoder

Use this table when a facilitator says a word that sounds like developer jargon.

| Term | What it means | Familiar analogy |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Repo** (repository) | A shared folder with version history | Like a OneDrive folder, but with tracked changes |
| **Clone** | Download a repo to your machine | Like "sync to my device" in OneDrive |
| **Git** | The tool that manages version history | Like Track Changes in Word, but for any file |
| **GitHub** | The website where repos live | Like SharePoint, but for code and documents |
| **Terminal / PowerShell** | A text-based way to talk to your computer | Like File Explorer, but you type instead of click |
| **Markdown (.md files)** | A simple text format with formatting | Like a Word doc, but plain text with `#` for headings |
| **MCP server** | A connector that lets Copilot talk to a system | Like a Power Automate connector |
| **Slash command** (`/help`) | A shortcut you type in Copilot CLI | Like a keyboard shortcut, but you type it |
| **Prompt** | What you type to Copilot CLI | Like what you'd say to a colleague — just in writing |

## What's next?

**Before the session:** Go to the [Setup Guide](pre-work/setup-guide.md) → then run the [Verify Checklist](pre-work/verify-checklist.md)

**Stuck on setup?** See [Setup Clinic](setup-clinic/README.md) — a 30–45 min guided session you can run before the main workshop.

**During the session:** Open [Exercise 1](exercises/exercise-01-build-your-briefing.md), [Exercise 2](exercises/exercise-02-pick-your-scenario.md), and [Exercise 3](exercises/exercise-03-your-copilot-passport.md) when the facilitator says "your turn"

**After the session:** Bookmark the [Cheat Sheet](reference/cheat-sheet.md) and check out [After-Session Resources](reference/after-session-resources.md)

**Want to go deeper async, or missed the workshop?** [Self-service course](self-service-course/README.md) — partner-flavored, 90 min – 3h, two tracks (📖 business / 🔧 technical).

## I'm stuck

- **During the session:** Raise your hand or ask in the Teams chat
- **After the session:** Check [Troubleshooting](reference/troubleshooting.md) or ask in the Teams channel
- **Or just ask CLI:** Type `How do I...` or `What went wrong?` — it understands
- **General CLI help:** https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli
